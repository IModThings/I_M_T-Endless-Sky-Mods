![Captured Archon](https://github.com/IModThings/I_M_T-Endless-Sky-Mods/blob/master/Endless%20Addon/images/ship/archborg.png?raw=true)
An Archon captured by the syndicate and fitten with control devices and modified weaponery. Fortunatly the syndicate was unable to access the most powerful of the Drak weaponery but this is still a fearsome weapon in the wrong hands.

![Tazership](https://github.com/IModThings/I_M_T-Endless-Sky-Mods/blob/master/Endless%20Addon/images/ship/tazership-img.png?raw=true)

This ship, originally created to explot a vulnurability in a malfunctioning Korath ship, is fitted with a powerful electrical arc weapon which bypasses shields entirely and does massive amounts of damage.
